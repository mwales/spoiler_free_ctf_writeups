===== Writeups for sample challenge =====

CTF organizers should have a landing page for each challenge in their CTF.  That will help players verify that their flag doesn't have a typo.  If a player gets to an empty landing page, they should double-check their flag is correct.

Here are some links to sample writeups:

[[challenge_sample_flag_writeup_by_l33t_hackers|l33t_hackers writeup]]

[[challenge_sample_flag_writeup_by_th3_n00b5|th3_n00b5 writeup]]

You can create a link to your own writeup by editing the landing page and adding a link with the following syntax:

<code>
[[challenge_babys_first_pwn_by_your_team_name|your_team_name writeup]]
</code>

===Very Important:  Make sure your page name starts with the word challenge_ so it's stays hidden! ===

===Also Important:  Page name should be unique ===

After you create the link, it should be red because no one created the page.  Once you click a red link the wiki ask you if you want to create a new page.  Edit that page using the doku wiki syntax!
